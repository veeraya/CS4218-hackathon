Usage: wc [-lmw] [FILE ...]
Counts newlines, characters and words in files

Options:
  -l:	The number of newlines in each input file is written to the standard output
  -m:	The number of characters in each input file is written to the standard output.
  -w:	The number of words in each input file is written to the standard output.
  
When an option is specified, wc only reports the information requested by that option.
The order of output always takes the form of line, character, word and file name.
The default action is equivalent to specifying the -l, -m, -w options.

If no files are specified, the standard input is used and no file name is displayed.  
The prompt will accept input until receiving EOF.
