Usage: uniq [OPTION]... [INPUT [OUTPUT]]
Filter adjacent matching lines from INPUT (or standard input),
writing to OUTPUT (or standard output).

With no options, matching lines are merged to the first occurrence.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -f, N   avoid comparing the first N fields
  -i,     ignore differences in case when comparing
  -help   display this help and exit

A field is a run of blanks (usually spaces and/or TABs), then non-blank
characters.  Fields are skipped before chars.

Note: 'uniq' does not detect repeated lines unless they are adjacent.
You may want to sort the input first, or use `sort -u' without `uniq'.
